// Much like the API folder's index.js file that collects the endpoints 
// and prefixes them, here we are collecting the packaged group 
// of API endpoints and prefixing them with the path /api. Also, 
// note that second use of router.use(). This is so if we make a 
// request to any endpoint that doesn't exist, we'll receive a 
// 404 error indicating we have requested an incorrect resource, 
// another RESTful API practice.

const router = require('express').Router();

const apiRoutes = require('./api');

router.use('/api', apiRoutes);

router.use((req, res) => {
  res.status(404).end();
